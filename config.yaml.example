# Sample CloudAWSync Configuration
# Edit this file to configure your cloud file synchronization settings

# AWS Configuration
aws:
  region: "us-east-1"
  s3_bucket: "my-backup-bucket"  # REQUIRED: Set your S3 bucket name
  s3_prefix: "cloudawsync/"      # Optional: Prefix for all uploaded files
  
  # AWS Credentials (can also be set via environment variables or IAM roles)
  access_key_id: ""              # Set to your AWS Access Key ID
  secret_access_key: ""          # Set to your AWS Secret Access Key
  session_token: ""              # Optional: For temporary credentials
  
  # Custom S3 endpoint for S3-compatible services (optional)
  endpoint: ""                   # e.g., "https://s3.amazonaws.com"

# Directories to synchronize
directories:
  # Example 1: Real-time sync of Documents folder
  - local_path: "/home/user/Documents"
    remote_path: "documents"
    sync_mode: "realtime"        # "realtime", "scheduled", or "both"
    schedule: ""                 # Not needed for realtime mode
    recursive: true              # Sync subdirectories
    enabled: true                # Enable this directory
    filters:                     # Exclude these file patterns
      - "*.tmp"
      - "*.lock"
      - "*.swp"
      - ".DS_Store"
      - "Thumbs.db"

  # Example 2: Scheduled sync of Pictures folder
  - local_path: "/home/user/Pictures"
    remote_path: "pictures"
    sync_mode: "scheduled"
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"        # Daily at 2:00 AM (cron format)
    recursive: true
    enabled: false               # Disabled by default - enable when ready
    filters:
      - "*.tmp"
      - "Thumbs.db"
      - ".thumbnails"

  # Example 3: Hybrid sync (both realtime and scheduled)
  - local_path: "/home/user/Projects"
    remote_path: "projects"
    sync_mode: "both"
    schedule: "0 0 * * 0"        # Weekly backup on Sunday at midnight
    recursive: true
    enabled: false
    filters:
      - "node_modules"
      - ".git"
      - "*.log"
      - "*.tmp"

# Logging Configuration
logging:
  level: "info"                  # "debug", "info", "warn", "error"
  format: "json"                 # "json" or "text"
  output_path: "/var/log/cloudawsync/cloudawsync.log"  # or "stdout"
  max_size: 100                  # Max log file size in MB
  max_age: 30                    # Keep logs for 30 days
  max_backups: 10                # Keep 10 backup files
  compress: true                 # Compress old log files

# Metrics and Monitoring
metrics:
  enabled: true                  # Enable Prometheus metrics
  port: 9090                     # Metrics server port
  path: "/metrics"               # Metrics endpoint path
  collect_interval: "30s"        # System metrics collection interval

# Security Settings
security:
  encryption_enabled: true       # Enable S3 server-side encryption
  encryption_key: ""             # Optional: Custom encryption key
  max_file_size: 104857600       # Max file size to sync (100MB)
  allowed_extensions: []         # Whitelist file extensions (empty = all allowed)
  denied_extensions:             # Blacklist file extensions
    - ".tmp"
    - ".lock"
    - ".swp"

# Performance Configuration
performance:
  max_concurrent_uploads: 5      # Number of simultaneous uploads
  max_concurrent_downloads: 5    # Number of simultaneous downloads
  upload_chunk_size: 5242880     # Upload chunk size (5MB)
  download_chunk_size: 5242880   # Download chunk size (5MB)
  retry_attempts: 3              # Number of retry attempts on failure
  retry_delay: "5s"              # Delay between retries
  timeout_duration: "30s"        # Operation timeout
  bandwidth_limit: 0             # Bandwidth limit in bytes/sec (0 = unlimited)

# SystemD Service Configuration
systemd:
  service_name: "cloudawsync"
  working_dir: "/opt/cloudawsync"
  user: "cloudawsync"
  group: "cloudawsync"
  restart_policy: "always"
  log_level: "info"

# Configuration Notes:
#
# 1. AWS Credentials:
#    - Can be set in this file, environment variables, or IAM roles
#    - Environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
#    - IAM roles are recommended for EC2 instances
#
# 2. Sync Modes:
#    - "realtime": Immediate sync on file changes
#    - "scheduled": Sync at specified times (cron format)
#    - "both": Combination of realtime and scheduled
#
# 3. Cron Schedule Format:
#    - Minute Hour Day Month Weekday
#    - "0 2 * * *" = Every day at 2:00 AM
#    - "0 0 * * 0" = Every Sunday at midnight
#    - "*/15 * * * *" = Every 15 minutes
#
# 4. File Filters:
#    - Use glob patterns to exclude files
#    - "*.tmp" excludes all .tmp files
#    - "node_modules" excludes directories named node_modules
#
# 5. Security:
#    - Always use encryption in production
#    - Set appropriate file size limits
#    - Use file filters to exclude sensitive files
#
# 6. Performance:
#    - Adjust concurrency based on system resources
#    - Larger chunk sizes = better throughput, more memory usage
#    - Set bandwidth limits if needed for network management
